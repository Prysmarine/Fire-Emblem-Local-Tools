This project is currently very basic in its functionality and under development. The current plan is to implement a stat modifier calculator for child units to more readily see the various combinations possible. Currently only Awakening is being supported, but plan to extend into newer games as well. 

Once the first part of Awakening is completed I have one of two paths: 
- Move onto the next game for the same basic functionality
- Implement more into Awakening before moving on and repeating the process

I believe this project will have 3 parts to it, showing each characters stat modifiers, letting you pick to see a child units stat modifiers, and see what each units maximum stats look like for a given class. Beyond this I don't know what else would be reasonable for this project, or what would even be useful.
